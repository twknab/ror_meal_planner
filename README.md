# TODO

Things to do:

* User login and registration with validations

* Create new meal with validations

* Read all meals

* Update meal

* Delete meal

* User Logout

* If time: Add in bootstrap

Plan out your database in advance. Consider that you'll need at the very least User and Meal models, and perhaps a MealPlan model as well depending upon how you wish to accomplish this application. Something to think about before getting started. You can use the default SQLite db for now if you'd like, but be sure to use the ActiveRecord ORM when performing your actions.
